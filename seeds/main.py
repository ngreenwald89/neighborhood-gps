'''
This file seeds our entire database with both preexisting files, like census and school data, and also makes fresh API calls for certain datasets, like yelp scores for each neighborhood.
This run file and the various functions and files that it calls was created in conjunction with other members of the team.

commands to run in repl:
>>>from tables.seeds import seed_db
>>>seed_db("tables/seeds/datasets/", "all")
